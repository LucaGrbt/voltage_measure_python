Measuring a voltage input with python (and RaspberryPi4), plotting voltage measure data actively with pyqtgraph (canvas) in a GUI


As I'm new to Python and spent a lot of time figuring out how to create a GUI for a voltage measuring app for my thesis in mechanical engineering I now want to present my solution:
I created the raw GUI in Qt Designer and converted it to Python code with PySide2.
